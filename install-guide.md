<h1>Abstract</h1>
<p>
 This write-up guides you through the step-by-step process on how to set up omnivory for those who are having a difficult time following the documentation, mainly beginners. To compile omniORBpy and generate it's
	python bindings we would also need the omniORB library
</p>

<h1>Pre-Requisites</h1>
<h3>Visual Studio Code</h3>
<p>Any version of Visual Studio will do; this will be needed to compile the omniORB package, alternatively, you can use MinGW to compile omniORB, although it is not that documented.
Including "Desktop Development for C++" saves you the hassle of fixing your PATH for C++ development so this is highly recommended as shown below:</p>

<h3>Cygwin</h3>
<p>This will be used on top of the installed packages from Visual Studio, refer to <a href="https://x.cygwin.com/docs/ug/setup.html">Cygwin site</a> to install cygwin. Ensure that you include "make" to your install of cygwin
shall you have problems retrieving the list of mirrors for the installer you can add <a href="https://www.cygwin.com/mirrors.html">these</a> as your mirror inside the installer using the GUI </p>
